# Census-Data-Analysis-Data-Cleaning
This Project analyses the population census of a town situated between two larger cities, to formulate decisions on future investments and decide necessary developments on an unoccupied plot of land. 

To formulate decisions based on the census, the data needs to be cleaned properly to rectify the errors and missing values.

# Data Cleaning 
The given Census data was cleaned up, to correct data errors and missing values. A complete record of all cleanup work undertaken can be accessed in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook.
